# Welcome to Threat Haven Lab: Building Your Ultimate Cybersecurity Environment (Part 1)

Hey security enthusiasts! I'm excited to introduce you to Threat Haven Lab - a comprehensive cybersecurity testing and learning environment. This is the first article in a series where I'll walk you through creating your own professional-grade security testing playground.

## Why Build a Dedicated Security Lab?

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, having a dedicated testing environment isn't just useful - it's essential. Threat Haven Lab was conceived with a clear vision: to create a space where security professionals can experiment, test, and learn without limitations. Modern cybersecurity requires hands-on experience with tools, techniques, and attack scenarios in a controlled environment. Reading about security concepts or watching demonstrations can only take you so far - real learning happens when you can freely experiment and see how systems and attacks work.

## What We'll Cover in This Series

This is going to be a deep dive, broken down into several articles:

1. Introduction and Planning (You're reading this one!)
2. Network Setup and Segmentation
3. Core Services and Infrastructure
4. Security Tools and Monitoring
5. Threat Simulation and Testing
6. Advanced Scenarios and Automation

## The Lab We're Building

I'm going to show you how to build something that's useful for real-world testing. Here's what we're aiming for:

### Core Infrastructure

* pfSense firewall (because it's awesome and free)
* Multiple network segments
* Active Directory (because it's still everywhere in the real world)
* Linux servers (Ubuntu Server is my go-to)
* Windows workstations

### Security Tools

I'm a big fan of open-source tools, so we'll be using:

* Wazuh for SIEM (seriously, it's amazing what you can do with this)
* Velociraptor for endpoint monitoring (this thing is a beast for forensics)
* Remnux for malware analysis
* Atomic Red Team for adversary emulation
### Initial Network Design

## Lab Requirements and Prerequisites

### Host System Requirements

* CPU: Intel/AMD processor with virtualization support (VT-x/AMD-V)
  * Minimum: 4 cores
  * Recommended: 8 cores or more
* RAM:
  * Minimum: 16GB
  * Recommended: 32GB or more
* Storage:
  * Minimum: 250GB free space
  * Recommended: 500GB+ SSD
* Operating System:
  * Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise
  * Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS

### Required Software

1. **VMware Workstation Pro 17 or newer**
   * Windows/Linux: VMware Workstation Pro
2. **Operating System ISOs**
   * Windows Server 2019/2022 ISO
   * Windows 10/11 Enterprise Evaluation
   * Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
   * pfSense CE ISO
   * Remnux Linux
3. **Forensics Tools**

## What's Next?

In the next article, we'll get our hands dirty with the network setup. I'll show you:

* How to configure pfSense with multiple interfaces
* Setting up VLANs for network segmentation
* Basic firewall rules to keep things organized

## Pro Tips Before We Start

* Document everything! Future you will thank past you
* Use snapshots liberally - they've saved my bacon many times
* Label your networks clearly - nothing worse than wondering which subnet is which at 2 AM
* Start small and expand - don't try to build everything at once

## Stay Tuned!

Next time, we'll start building this thing! Get ready to download some ISOs and clear some disk space. Feel free to drop questions in the comments - I'll try to address them in the upcoming articles.

Remember: the best security pros I know all have their own labs. It's where you can experiment, break things, and most importantly, learn without fear. Let's build something awesome together!
